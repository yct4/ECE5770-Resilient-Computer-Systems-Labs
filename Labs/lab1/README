ECE 5770 Lab 1 - Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Taken from: 

Syracuse SEED Lab (http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/all_labs.html)

This lab combines and modifies two labs found on the SEED website:

"Buffer Overflow Lab"
(http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Vulnerability/Buffer_Overflow)

"Return-to-libc Attack Lab"
(http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Vulnerability/Return_to_libc)

Instructions:

Please see lab handout for in-depth instructions. 
You will need to complete the TODO sections of 
"stack_shell.c" and "return_to_libc.c" to exploit
the vulnerability in the program "vulnerable.c"

The lab instructions describe which flags to use
to compile each file and how to run the exploit.

In order to effectively perform the lab, you will
need to understand the stack layout and calling
convention for x86.

The "call_shellcode.c" program demonstrates that
the provided shellcode array can start a shell
when executed as x86 instructions.
